## ‚ú® Features Implemented
- Fetch and display SpaceX launch data using **React Query**.
- View detailed information about each launch.
- Search launches by name.
- Filter launches by year.
- Toggle between **upcoming** and **past** launches.
- Mark launches as **favorites** (stored using AsyncStorage).
- Smooth UI with dark mode styling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **React Native** - For building the mobile application.
- **React Navigation** - For handling screen transitions.
- **@tanstack/react-query** - For efficient data fetching and caching.
- **Axios** - For making API requests to SpaceX API.
- **AsyncStorage** - For local storage of favorite launches.
- **react-native-expo-image-cache** - For optimized image loading.

## üöß Challenges Faced & Solutions
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Managing API Data Efficiently
- **Challenge:** Frequent API calls slowed the app and led to unnecessary re-renders.
- **Solution:** Used **React Query** to cache responses, reducing redundant network requests.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Image Load Failures
- **Challenge:** Some launches had missing images, causing UI breakage.
- **Solution:** Used a fallback image (`https://via.placeholder.com/200`) if an image URL was unavailable.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Persistent Storage for Favorites
- **Challenge:** Marking launches as favorites was not persistent across app restarts.
- **Solution:** Integrated **AsyncStorage** to store and retrieve favorite launches locally.

---

## üîÆ Future Improvements
- Implement push notifications for upcoming launches.
- Add a launch countdown timer for future missions.
- Improve UI animations for a smoother user experience.
- Support offline caching for better performance in low-network conditions.
- Display detailed rocket specifications from the SpaceX API.
